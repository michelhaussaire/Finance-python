- **Return Calculations**: 
  - Daily portfolio returns computation
  - Cumulative returns analysis
  - Benchmark comparison against S&P 500 index
- **Risk Assessment**: Portfolio volatility calculation using covariance matrix methodology
- **Data Visualization**: 
  - Comparative performance charts (Portfolio vs S&P 500)
  - Portfolio composition pie charts with equal weighting
- **Risk Metrics**: Portfolio risk analysis compared to benchmark volatility

### `test_tradingview_ta.ipynb`
**Automated Technical Analysis with TradingView**

This notebook demonstrates the integration of `tradingview_ta` library for automated technical analysis:

- **Analysis Configuration**: Connects to TradingView API for specific symbol analysis (example: 'X' symbol on NYSE)
- **Technical Indicators**: Comprehensive indicator suite including:
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - Stochastic Oscillators (Stoch.K, Stoch.D)
  - CCI (Commodity Channel Index)
  - ADX (Average Directional Index)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Moving Averages (EMA, SMA across multiple timeframes)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Pivot Points (Classic, Fibonacci, Camarilla, Woodie, Demark)
- **Trading Recommendations**: Automated buy/sell recommendations based on technical analysis
- **Executive Summary**: Consolidated recommendation output (BUY/SELL/NEUTRAL) with signal distribution

### `test_backtesting.ipynb`
**Trading Strategy Backtesting Framework**

This notebook implements and validates trading strategies using the `backtesting` library:

- **Strategy Implementation**: SMACross (Simple Moving Average Crossover)
  - Short-term MA: 50 periods
  - Long-term MA: 100 periods
  - Buy signal: Short MA crosses above Long MA
  - Sell signal: Long MA crosses above Short MA

- **Backtest Configuration**:
  - Initial capital: $10,000
  - Commission structure: 0.2%
  - Dataset: SPY ETF from 2018-01-01

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Total and annualized returns
  - Volatility and risk-adjusted ratios (Sharpe, Sortino)
  - Maximum and average drawdown analysis
  - Trade statistics and win rate
  - Profit factor and expectancy calculations

- **Parameter Optimization**: Automated optimization for optimal moving average parameters
- **Interactive Visualization**: Bokeh-powered interactive charts featuring:
  - Equity curve evolution
  - Entry/exit point markers
  - Technical indicator overlays
  - Drawdown period analysis
